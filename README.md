# Random Access Memory (RAM)

Random Access Memory (RAM) is a form of computer memory that stores data
and program instructions currently being used by the computer's Central
Processing Unit (CPU). It is the primary memory of a computer system.

## Key Characteristics

### Volatile

RAM is volatile memory, meaning it requires continuous power to retain
the stored data. Once the power is turned off, all data in RAM is lost.
This is in contrast to non-volatile storage like a Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
or Solid State Drive (SSD).

### Fast

RAM is significantly faster than secondary storage devices (like HDDs or
SSDs). This speed is crucial because the CPU constantly needs to read
and write data from RAM to perform tasks efficiently.

### Random Access

The term "Random Access" means that the CPU can access any memory
location directly and quickly, regardless of the previous memory
location it accessed. This is unlike sequential access, where the system
must read through previous data.

### Temporary Storage

RAM acts as the system's working space. It holds the operating system,
applications, and data currently in use, allowing the CPU to access them
rapidly. When you open an application, it is loaded from the storage
drive into RAM.

## How RAM Works

-   When you start your computer, the operating system (OS) is loaded
    from your storage drive (SSD/HDD) into the RAM.
-   When you open an application (like a web browser or a game), the
    necessary program files and data are also loaded into RAM.
-   The CPU constantly fetches instructions and data from the RAM,
    processes them, and stores results back in RAM.

Since RAM is fast, this process happens rapidly, which is why having
more RAM leads to a smoother and more responsive experience.

## Types of RAM

### 1. Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

-   **Structure:** DRAM stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor
    and transistor.
-   **Function:** Capacitors leak charge, so data must be refreshed
    periodically (hundreds of times per second), hence "Dynamic."
-   **Use:** Most common type for main system memory due to high density
    and lower cost.
-   **Forms:** SDRAM → DDR SDRAM generations (DDR4, DDR5).
-   **Generations:** Newer generations provide higher speed, lower power
    consumption, and greater bandwidth.

### 2. Static RAM (SRAM)

-   **Structure:** Each bit is stored using a six-transistor circuit.
-   **Function:** Does not require refreshing as long as power is
    supplied, hence "Static."
-   **Use:** Faster but more expensive; used mainly in CPU cache (L1,
    L2, L3).

## RAM vs Storage (HDD/SSD)

| Feature     | RAM (Primary Memory) | Storage (Secondary Memory) |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Temporary workspace for active programs and data | Permanent storage for files, apps, OS |
| **Speed** | Very fast (GHz/MHz, nanoseconds) | Slower (MB/s or GB/s) |
| **Volatility** | Volatile (data lost when power is off) | Non-volatile |
| **Capacity** | 4GB to 128GB | 256GB to 24TB+ |
| **Cost** | More expensive per GB | Less expensive per GB |


## How Much RAM You Need

-   **8GB:** Basic tasks like browsing, email, office apps.
-   **16GB:** General computing, moderate gaming, light creative work.
-   **32GB+:** Heavy workloads---video editing, 3D rendering, high-end
    gaming, running VMs.
